        <h2>Key Points:</h2>
        <h3>Character Creation:</h3>

            <p>
                The first, and arguably most important, part of the Baldurs Gate experience is the character creation. First, you will choose your race there are a total of 11 races to choose from. Within races there are sub-races, these will determine certain bonus points that will be
                allocated to your character. For example, if you were to be of the race elf then you could choose between 2 sub races, High-elf and Wood. After choosing your race and sub-race you will move on to your class. There are 12 classes you can choose from. The class
                you choose will determine what kind of abilities you specialize in during combat. Then within certain classes there will be sub-classes to assign further bonuses and attacks. Once you determine your class you will then decide on the background of your character.
                The background of your character will give even more bonus and also establish a certain skill set your character might have. Finally you will move on to the physical attributes of character creation. From skin color to facial markers you can create your own unique character
                to explore with. However there is a slight downside to the character creation. You can only pick from a few predetermined facial structures that are unable to changed. Despite this slight set back the character creation from baldurs gate is phenomenial and will
                allow for you to create a range of characters with their own special characteristics.
            </p>
        <h3>Custom Party</h3>
            <p>
                Baldurs Gate is set in a D&D expierence and one of the most important features of D&D is the ability to establish a party. As you travel around the map you will meet a range of characters that are willing to help you in this journey to cure yourself.
                Each member can have their own set of skills and utilities that will assist in your battle strategy. Most importantly its all customizable so if you descide you don't want a particular character on your journey you dont have to bring them along. You can even kill off 
                particular characters, if you feel so inclined. All is up to whatever your personal playstyle is. Each member has their own story that the character can learn about by speaking with them and choosing options that they agree with. You can even have a little bit of romance
                within the party if you want.
